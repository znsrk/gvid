        "options": [
          "A NEAR call is faster than a FAR call.",
          "A NEAR call is used for calls within the same code segment, while a FAR call is used for calls to a different code segment.",
          "A FAR call uses more registers than a NEAR call.",
          "There is no difference between NEAR and FAR calls."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A NEAR call is used for calling procedures within the same code segment, requiring only the instruction pointer (IP) to be saved/restored. A FAR call is used for calling procedures in a different code segment, requiring both the code segment (CS) and instruction pointer (IP) to be saved/restored."
      },
      {
        "id": "q14",
        "question": "Consider the following assembly code snippet: `MOV AX, [BX]`. What is being performed?",
        "options": [
          "The value of AX is moved to the memory location pointed to by BX.",
          "The value at the memory location pointed to by BX is moved into AX.",
          "The address of BX is moved into AX.",
          "AX and BX are added together and the result is stored in AX."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The square brackets `[]` around `BX` indicate memory addressing. Therefore, the code is moving the value stored at the memory location whose address is held in the `BX` register into the `AX` register."
      },
      {
        "id": "q15",
        "question": "What is an interrupt in assembly programming?",

          "They are independent of each other.",
          "Frequency is the square root of wavelength."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional. The speed of light (c) is constant, and c = fλ.  Therefore, as frequency increases, wavelength decreases, and vice-versa."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "When light enters a medium with a refractive index greater than 1, its speed decreases. Since the frequency remains the same, the wavelength must decrease to maintain the relationship c = fλ, where c is the speed of light."
